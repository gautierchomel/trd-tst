A book can be added to the library by opening it with Thorium
from Windows Explorer or by importing it with the
`Import Book` button.
When a book is imported, it is copied and prepared in a reserved folder. 

{{< alert danger >}}

Thorium copies files in a publications subfolder of the EDRLab.ThoriumReader folder. The location of this folder may vary depending on the operating system and may be placed in a hidden folder, you will need to activate display hidden files option to find it. 

Keep in mind that this folder is sensitive because linked to Thorium bookshelf database. For backups or moving from one computer to another, use the `Export` button from the book menu. We hope soon to propose an option to export all titles.

## My Books

The imported books are presented in the `My Books` menu.
It offers a quick access view organized into two sections:
`Recently added` and `Resume reading`. The `All Books`  
button will display all the books imported into Thorium.

The default view is the grid view (<img class="icons" src="/images/icons/baseline-view_module-24px.svg" alt="Icon grid" width="20px">), it shows the book covers, title and author.
Clicking on any of these items will open the book in a new
window. A menu for each book allows you to access the `Book File`,
`Delete` or `Export` the book.

It is possible to choose display as a `list view` (<img class="icons" src="/images/icons/baseline-view_list-24px.svg" alt="Icon list" width="20px">), in this view the cover is no longer
displayed but the year of publication and the publisher are shown.

## All Books

The ``All books`` view is organized as a table, it displays all the
information for each book. If information is missing it means that it has not
been provided by the creator of the book. The majority of the
information can be activated and triggers a quick search on the keyword.
For example, click on the word *English* in the language column to see only
books in English displayed.

The column headers allow you to sort the books in ascending or descending order.
The `magnifying glass` icon
(<img class="icons" src="/images/icons/magnifying_glass.svg" alt="" width="20px">)
in the header of the first column activates a search field by column
allowing for example to search for an expression only among the titles
of the works.
