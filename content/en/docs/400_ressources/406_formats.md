 has been designed by the W3C Publishing Working Group in 2020, and EDRLab
 was part of this WG. Thorium is supporting the
 <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/lpf/">packaged (LPF)</a> audiobook format,
 which will soon be widely used by booksellers, or so we hope.

<dt>Visual narratives</dt>
<dd> EDRLab has designed a standard format for
 comics, manga, webtoons and other styles of digital works based on
 sequances of images.
 <a href="https://www.edrlab.org/open-standards/">Divina</a> is the name of
 this format. This is still an experimental format, and we hope that
 publishers will size it in 2021+.
